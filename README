A simple template for creating conference name badges.

The size of the badges is determined by the right/bottom margin parameters and the badgerows/badgecolumns variables.

If needed, line breaks can be added manually to the csv file. Font can also be changed for a single badge in the csv file. See the sample participants.csv and example.pdf files.
